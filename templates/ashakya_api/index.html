        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Louisiana State University. My research interests lie in designing graph-based neural networks to model complex relationships and interactions inherent in various physical systems. Additionally, I am passionate about creating robust and reliable AI models that not only deliver accurate predictions but also quantify the uncertainty associated with these predictions. I enjoy building trading algorithms for fun. It is my way of trying to teach my computer to earn its keep around here--so far, it hasn't asked for a raise!</p>
